## Introduction
GuardianAI is a rule-based chat prototype designed to ensure ethical and legal compliance when using generative AI tools in the workplace. It integrates real-time monitoring, risk-based alerting, and dynamic rule adjustment to maintain high standards of AI governance.

## Features
- **Document Analysis**: Upload policy documents to analyze and extract compliance rules automatically.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor interactions with AI in real-time to ensure compliance with established rules.
- **Risk-Based Alerting**: Set risk thresholds and receive alerts when interactions potentially breach these thresholds.
- **Admin Controls**: Administrators can review and adjust monitoring rules and risk thresholds as needed.

## Installation
To run GuardianAI on your local machine, you will need Python and several dependencies installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS and Linux:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Installing Dependencies
Install all required packages with pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Once the environment is set up and all dependencies are installed, you can run the application using:

bash
streamlit run app.py
Usage
After launching the application, you will be prompted to upload a document. The system will analyze the document, extract compliance-related rules, and allow you to interact with a chatbot that respects these rules.
